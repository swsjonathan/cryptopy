# cryptopy

A personal project to learn cryptogrphy by implementing cryptographic algorithms in python. I will periodically update this repo with the algorithms I learn and the implmentations of it

## Goal 
- To implement major cryptographic algorithms, and understand the base concepts of it. 
- Audit my programs after I have implemented, to identify security issues and learn how to fix them. 

> Coming soon: Tutorials on learning cryptography and using this repository to study it :)
